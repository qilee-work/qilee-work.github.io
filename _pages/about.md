I am a PHD from the Institute of Information Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research direction is federated learning, which is a distributed machine learning algorithm. The goal of federated learning is how a trusted central server can coordinate multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without leaking privacy.

In the past two  years, My work focused on how to improve the performance of the global model in non-i.i.d setting. Now, I am conducting research on differential privacy, with the goal of improving the model security capabilities of federated learning.
